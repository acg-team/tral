Tandem Repeat annotation library
================================

TRAL makes annotation of tandem repeats in amino acid and nucleic data simple. TRAL includes
modules for detecting tandem repeats with both de novo software and sequence profile HMMs;
statistical significance analysis of putative tandem repeats, and filterting of redundant predictions.

A manuscript describing TRAL is soon to be submitted.


Getting started
===============

#. :ref:`Install TRAL <install>`
