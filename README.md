# Tandem Repeat Annotation Library

TRAL is a highly modularized, flexible sequence tandem repeats annotation Python2/3 library.

- Large scale annotation of tandem repeats with *de novo* detectors, and sequence profile models  
- Statistical significance testing, overlap detection, and filtering of annotations  
- Refinement of tandem repeat annotations with circular profile hidden Markov models  
- User-defined output formats  

The source code is [documented on GitHub IO].

### Version

2.0

### Installation

It is recommended to use TRAL with the [docker image] or install it locally with the [easy_setup] system.

### License

GPL-2.0

### Dependencies

Some of TRAL's functions depend on external software ([Installation instructions for dependencies]). This includes creation of sequence profile hidden Markov models, alignment of tandem repeat units, and *de novo* repeat detection.
