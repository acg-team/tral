# INSTALLING T-REKS #####
# T-REKS: identification of Tandem Repeats in sequences with a K-meanS based algorithm.
# T-REKS is an algorithm for de novo detection and alignment of repeats in sequences based on K-means algorithm.
# Minimal length of repeat arrays is 9 for true homorepeats and 14 for other repeats with potential biological meaning.

wget --no-check-certificate "$LINK_TREKS" -P "$TRAL_EXT_SOFTWARE" # no check certificate because otherwise the download will fail
