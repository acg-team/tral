# INSTALLING XSTREAM #####
# XSTREAM: variable sequence tandem repeats extraction and architecture modeling
# XSTREAM is a tool for rapidly identifying and modeling the architecture of “fundamental” Tandem Repeats (TRs) in protein sequences.
# Due to the general nature of TRs, however, any sequence including DNA (or even numbers!) can be processed. 
# XSTREAM is freely available only for academic non-profit use and may not be distributed or copied without permission.
# For questions regarding XSTREAM availability, please contact the XSTREAM team.

### Installation XSTREAM

mkdir -p "$TRAL_EXT_SOFTWARE/XSTREAM"
if [ ! -f "$TRAL_EXT_SOFTWARE/XSTREAM/xstream.jar" ]; then # test if not already in directory
    LINK_XSTREAM="http://jimcooperlab.mcdb.ucsb.edu/xstream/XSTREAMprog/xstream.zip"
    wget "$LINK_XSTREAM" -P "$TRAL_EXT_SOFTWARE/XSTREAM"
    unzip "$TRAL_EXT_SOFTWARE/XSTREAM/xstream.zip" -d "$TRAL_EXT_SOFTWARE/XSTREAM"
    rm -rf "$TRAL_EXT_SOFTWARE/XSTREAM/xstream.zip" || {
        echo "Was not able to download or unzip XSTREAM"
        exit $?

chmod +x "$TRAL_EXT_SOFTWARE/XSTREAM/XSTREAM"
cp "$TRAL_EXT_SOFTWARE/XSTREAM/XSTREAM" "$INSTALLATION_PATH"  # copy wrapper file to execute XSTREAM into system path
chmod +x "$INSTALLATION_PATH/XSTREAM" && echo -e "\nXSTREAM is in your path $INSTALLATION_PATH and can be executed with the command \"XSTREAM\""

# XSTREAM is executable with the command XSTREAM
