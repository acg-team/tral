        # Tandem Repeat Annotation Library
        
        TRAL is a highly modularized, flexible sequence tandem repeats annotation Python2/3 library.
        
        - Large scale annotation of tandem repeats with *de novo* detectors, and sequence profile models  
        - Statistical significance testing, overlap detection, and filtering of annotations  
        - Refinement of tandem repeat annotations with circular profile hidden Markov models  
        - User-defined output formats  
        
        The source code is [documented on GitHub IO].
        
        ### Version

        ### Installation
        
        It is recommended to use TRAL with the [docker image] or install it locally with the [easy_setup] system.

        ### Dependencies
        
        Some of TRAL's functions depend on external software ([Installation instructions for dependencies]). This includes creation of sequence profile hidden Markov models, alignment of tandem repeat units, and *de novo* repeat detection.
