# Tandem Repeat Annotation Library

TRAL is a highly modularized, flexible sequence tandem repeats annotation Python2/3 library.

  - Large scale annotation of tandem repeats with *de novo* detectors, and sequence profile models
  - Statistical significance testing, overlap detection, and filtering of annotations
  - Refinement of tandem repeat annotations with circular profile hidden Markov models
  - User-defined output formats

The source code is [documented on GitHub IO].

### Version
0.3.5


### Installation

It is recommended to install TRAL with the [easy_setup] system.


### License

GPL-2.0


### Dependencies

Some of TRAL's functions depend on external software ([Installation instructions for dependencies]). This includes creation of sequence profile hidden Markov models, alignment of tandem repeat units, and *de novo* repeat detection.
