Tandem Repeat Annotation Library
================================

TRAL makes annotation of tandem repeats in amino acid and nucleic data simple. TRAL includes
modules for detecting tandem repeats with both de novo software and sequence profile HMMs;
statistical significance analysis of putative tandem repeats, and filtering of redundant predictions.


Getting started
===============

#. :ref:`Install TRAL <install>`
#. :ref:`Install tandem repeat external software <install_external>`
