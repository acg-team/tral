Configuration
=============

Here you see how to configure TRAL after installation. All configuration files are located
in your home directory:
::

    ~/.tral/


configs.ini - REQUIRED: Supply paths to external software and data.
-------------------------------------------------------------------

In configs.ini you can set the paths to all external software and data used in TRAL, as well
as change default thresholds and behaviours.


*De novo* repeat detection
**************************
Enlist all *de novo* detection algorithms you wish to use. All other algorithms are ignored
by default.
::

    [sequence]
        [[repeat_detection]]
            AA = HHrepID, T-REKS, TRUST, XSTREAM  # List of default de novo detectors on amino acid data that you wish to use.
            DNA = PHOBOS, XSTREAM  #List of default de novo detectors on nucleic data that you wish to use.


If the binaries or executable scripts of any *de novo* detection algorithm are not in the
system path, set the absolute paths in config.ini. Details for each detector (e.g. to create
executable scripts) are detailed in :ref:`Installation of external software <install_external>`.
::

    [sequence]
        [[repeat_detector_path]]
            PHOBOS = phobos
            HHrepID = hhrepid_64
            HHrepID_dummyhmm = /path/to/home/.tral/data/hhrepid/dummyHMM.hmm
            TRUST = TRUST
            TRUST_substitutionmatrix = /path/to/TRUST/Align/BLOSUM50  #Recommended: Use matrices packages shipped with TRUST
            XSTREAM = XSTREAM
            [...]


Build Hmmer models
******************

If *hmmbuild* is not in your system path, define the absolute path::

    [hmm]
        hmmbuild = path/to/hmmbuild


Realign tandem repeat units
***************************
At current, tandem repeat units are realigned with Mafft's ginsi global aligner. This is
required for example if you annotate tandem repeats from profile models. If *ginsi* is
not in your system path, define the absolute path::

    [repeat]
        ginsi = /path/to/ginsi

Additionally, all detected tandem repeats (either from profile models or *denovo* can be realigned with the indel-aware proPIP alignment algorithm.
To use proPIP you need to have Castor (incl. aligner) which ships with proPIP. If *Castor* is not in your system path, define the absolute path::

    [repeat]
        Castor = /path/to/Castor
        [[castor_parameter]]
            rate_distribution = constant # either constant or gamma


Simulation of evolution in tandem repeats
*****************************************

If *alfsim* is not in your system path, set the absolute path::

	[repeat]
		alfsim = path/to/alfsim


configs.ini - OPTIONAL: Change TRAL's default behaviour
-----------------------------------------------------------

Define the default filter behaviour.
*****************************************

::

    [filter]
        [[basic]]
            tag = basic_filter
            [[[dict]]]
                [[[[pvalue]]]]
                    func_name = pvalue
                    score = phylo_gap01  # score
                    threshold = 0.1  # p-Value cut-off
                [[[[n_effective]]]]
                    func_name = attribute
                    attribute = n_effective  # attribute of tandem repeat, e.g. the repeat unit length l_effective
                    type = min
                    threshold = 1.9  # p-Value cut-off



Creation of new Repeat instances
*********************************

::

    [repeat]
        scoreslist = phylo_gap01,  # score
        calc_score = False  # Is the score calculated?
        calc_pvalue = False # Is the pvalue calculated?
        precision = 10
        ginsi = /path/to/ginsi  # Path to the mafft global aligner ginsi.
        Castor = Castor
        [[castor_parameter]]
            rate_distribution = constant # either constant or gamma
        alfsim = alfsim


Statistical significance calculation and models of repeat evolution
*******************************************************************

::

    [repeat_score]
        evolutionary_model = lg  # All models need to be available in /path/to/TandemRepeats/tandemrepeats/data/paml/
        [[indel]]
            indelRatePerSite = 0.01  # What magnitude is the indel rate compared to the substitution rate?
            ignore_gaps = True  # Shall trailing gaps be ignored / not penalised?
            gaps = row_wise
            zipf = 1.821
        [[optimisation]]
            start_min = 0.5
            start_max = 1.5
            nIteration = 14
        [[K80]]
            kappa = 2.59
        [[TN93]]
            alpha_1 = 0.3
            alpha_2 = 0.4
            beta = 0.7
    [[score_calibration]]
        scoreslist=phylo_gap01,
        save_calibration = False
        precision = 10


Creation of new Repeat list instances
************************************************************

::

    [repeat_list]
        output_characteristics = begin, msa_original, l_effective, n_effective, repeat_region_length, divergence, pvalue
        model = phylo_gap01


Restrict Hmmer model size.
****************************

Set the maximum size of HMM for which the Viterbi algorithm is performed *l_effective_max* e.g.
to ensure viable run-times on your system::

    [hmm]
        l_effective_max = 50

logging.ini - OPTIONAL
-----------------------

In this file, you can define the level of debugging per module (DEBUG, INFO, WARNING), and
the format of the debugging message. Defaults to WARNING. The path to the file needs to be
defined as

::

    import logging
    import logging.config
    logging.config.fileConfig("path/to/your/home/.tral/logging.ini")
